1: Flat is always better than nested.
2: Communicate using functions not data : Rather then sending data to other objects use an objects methods to edit the data it holds. Every object should be the sole ownser of its data and communicate with other using methods.
3: keep at the dependencies at top level.
4: Always define the Objective of an object and then Do not change the Objective of an object
5: Move things which needs dependencies and which do not need dependencies seperate and try to isolate depencies.
