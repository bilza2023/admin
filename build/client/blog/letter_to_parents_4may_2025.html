  <h1>📢 A Message to Parents Regarding Their Children's Education</h1>
  <hr />

  <p>🎯 With 30+ years in computer education, I want to share key insights to help parents guide their children in an AI-driven world.</p>

  <hr />
  <h2>🧭 10 Key Messages</h2>

  <h3>1. 🏭 Think Industry, Not Subjects</h3>
  <p>Choose subjects based on the future industry your child is likely to join.</p>

  <h3>2. 💻 Computer Literacy is Now Basic Literacy</h3>
  <p>A person with basic computer skills stands far ahead of the uneducated and not far behind the highly educated.</p>

  <h3>3. 🤖 Understand the AI Era</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>AI is no longer optional — every decision about careers must now include its impact.</li>
    <li>The AI revolution is ongoing — it’s expanding fast and will define the next decade.</li>
    <li>AI is reshaping every industry — just like computers once did, but more deeply.</li>
    <li>AI will create new roles — especially in automation, coding, and system design.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. 🎓 Rethink Education for the AI Era</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Subjects are shifting from theory to practical: think <em>Process Automation</em> instead of <em>Social Studies</em>.</li>
    <li>Education will be shorter, focused, and skill-based.</li>
    <li>Degrees will matter less — real-world ability will matter more.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. 🗣️ Learn to Learn & Soft Skills Matter</h3>
  <p>Adaptability, communication, curiosity, and emotional intelligence will outlast any technical trend.</p>

  <h3>6. 🌐 Online is the New Marketplace</h3>
  <p>No matter what you make and where you make it—you will sell it online.</p>

  <h3>7. 📊 Data Skills Are the New Math</h3>
  <p>Understanding and working with data is now a fundamental skill — as important as basic arithmetic once was.</p>

  <h3>8. 🧭 Career Paths Will Be Non-Linear</h3>
  <p>Success won't follow a straight path; careers will evolve, switch domains, and require constant reinvention.</p>

  <h3>9. 🎯 Domain Knowledge is Part of the Education</h3>
  <p>The knowledge of the industry that you want to make money from should be part of your education.</p>

  <h3>10. 🎯 Skills Speak Louder Than Degrees</h3>
  <p>In today's world, your ability to deliver results matters far more than your academic credentials alone.</p>
  
  
  <hr />
  <h2>💼 The Future Job Market</h2>

  <h3>1. 🧾 End of Traditional Jobs</h3>
  <p>Long-term jobs with pensions are disappearing.</p>

  <h3>2. 📄 Rise of Contracts</h3>
  <p>Work will be short-term, task-based, and flexible.</p>

  <h3>3. 🧠 Highly Skilled Teams</h3>
  <p>Small, smart, technical teams will lead the way.</p>

  <h3>4. 🚚 Outsourcing Will Prevail</h3>
  <p>Whatever can be outsourced, will be outsourced.</p>

  <h3>5. 🏛️ Disappearing Government Jobs</h3>
  <p>Government jobs all over the world will pay less and offer fewer benefits in the future.</p>
